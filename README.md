## Motivation and Purpose
The number of global cryptocurrency users reached 221 million (Wang, 2021). However, for many the understanding of its base technology, the Blockchain, is precarius or even non-existent. That said, this project proposes to develop a cryptocurrency trading app for iOS devices in a local network using Blockchain technology.
<br/><br/>

## Methodology
Initially, a bibliographical research was made regarding the structures and processes of Blockchain. The model proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto (2008) describes the composition of a block, the construction of a history based on computational work proof and validation with digital signatures. After this investigative process, low and high fidelity prototypes were built in order to guide the development and understand how to adapt Nakamoto's model to mobile devices.
The Blockchain was developed in Swift and implemented based on two main native frameworks: CryptoKit, for encryption procedures, and MultipeerConnectivity, for peer-to-peer communication.

**Caption**: Blockchain workflow in local network for iOS devices, implemented in CryptoLeo.

## Results
The project objective was achieved by implementing Blockchain on an iOS app, that allow users to trade and audit CryptoLeo, a fictitious cryptocurrency.
<br/><br/>

## Conclusions
Blockchain is a technology that presents a secure, distributed and auditable way to store information. The implementation for local network proves to be limited, since there is no continuity of connection and low limit of participants. However, the implementation of Blockchain in mobile devices is viable and scalable for remote networks, bringing the end user closer and making them more participative in the processes that composes the technology.
